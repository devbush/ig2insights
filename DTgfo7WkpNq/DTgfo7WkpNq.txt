I've grown over 10,000 followers in the past month, and I've done it by focusing 100% of my effort on one thing. And the thing is, this strategy, it's not just for content, it works for everything in your life. Every speech, every presentation, every conversation. It's the reason I've been able to build a successful clothing brand. It's the reason I was able to raise a million dollars in VC funding for my startup. And it's something you should always be conscious of. That thing is progressive intrigue. Let me explain. Every video you make or thing you say is in some form a story. Even if it's like a tutorial video, you're telling a story. So you have to ask yourself, what makes a good story? A good story is when the plot continues to thicken. Every time you say something, you should be delivering both payoff and mystery. Every sentence should make the listener feel both enlightened and unsatisfied. The question your listener should always be asking themselves is, "What happens next?" Lots of creators say that to grow your page, all you need to worry about is the hook. I respectfully disagree. The hook is where the progressive intrigue matters the most, because it's the first thing the listener hears, but it shouldn't be the only place you do it. This is probably the reason that you might have copied somebody's hook from the past, but didn't see the same success from it. The same thing goes for a conversation. A good conversation is one where every line of dialogue is progressively more intriguing than the previous line of dialogue. To implement this strategy, start thinking about imaginary transition words between every sentence. If those transition words aren't "therefore", "however", or "for example", the sentence does not belong. If you don't believe me, rewatch this entire video and pay attention to every sentence. And then you'll see.
