I made a decision about my life in 2025 that I believe has been the most impactful decision I have ever made and I think a lot of people would benefit from making the same decision. But first, a little bit of context. By the way, I'm just going to be completely honest with you. If I sound arrogant or dickish, then... For most of my life, I have been told that I have a lot of potential, which is a very flattering thing to hear. I mean, who doesn't want to be told that, especially if you're like a younger kid? So every time I would hear that sentence, all it really did for me was make my ego bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. And throughout all of it, I saw enough conventional success from society to make me think I was fulfilling that potential. But I wasn't. I was just trying to achieve more things that are signs of potential to feed that big-ass ego of mine. You see, according to the laws of physics, potential is just energy that has not been expended yet. Therefore, the sentence "you have a lot of potential" is just a nice way of saying that you have not done the things that you are capable of doing. But you see, the real problem is that the ego that you get from that sentence is the very thing that stops you from fulfilling that potential. So I realized that in order to fulfill my potential, I have to get out of my own way, potentially be willing to do things like this that I thought I was above. A decision I made in 2025 was to stop having potential. Life is too short to have potential, man. Just do the shit that you know you can do.
