Kaisenat is trying to become a better speaker by reading out loud for 15 minutes at a time. This is a pretty good strategy, but if I were Kaisenat's personal speaking coach, here are four more strategies I would give him to help him become a better speaker. First, work on annunciation. He's already kind of doing this with the reading, but Kaisenat tends to speak really fast, which causes him to not annunciate certain words sometimes. So I would have him keep doing the reading drill, but make him annunciate every single word, like to an obnoxious extent. Even words like "of" or "the" should be annunciated super clearly. To take it a step even further, I would have him read out loud with a pen in his mouth, literally have him speak like this. This drill will force him to pronounce words far more clearly, and he will literally see the result as soon as he takes the pen out of his mouth. If you don't believe me, try it yourself. Second, I would have him work on speaking on topics off the top of his head. How you say things is half the challenge. What you say is the other half. The best way to train this is learning how to speak on the fly. As an ex-live streamer, Kaisenat is no stranger to this. To do this, I would give him a random topic and force him to speak on it for 10 straight minutes with no preparation. As he does this more and more, his ability to think while he speaks will improve. Third, I would tell Kaisenat to keep practicing publicly. Everybody in the comments is clowning Kaisenat for the way that he reads in these videos, but I'm sure for him this was not only expected, but beneficial. It ain't good that anything meaningful requires some form of a humiliation ritual. And finally, fourth, I would have him join the waitlist for speakeasy. Or if he happens to see this, I would give him early access so he can practice on his own every day.
