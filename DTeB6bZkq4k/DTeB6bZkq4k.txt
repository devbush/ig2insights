Was Timothy Chalamet nervous during his Golden Globes acceptance speech? Like, look at his body language. He looks a little nervous. This is something that's always confused me about actors at these award shows. How can they possibly be nervous when giving a speech? By the way, I think I've figured out the answer to this question. And it's low key like a life-changing answer, like it's applicable to you. But first, I can't be the only person that's been confused by this. I mean, these people are actors. Their profession is to perform, to get up and speak and communicate. Dage fright should not apply to them. But apparently it does. Look at Seth Rogen's speech from the Golden Globes. He's been performing for decades, yet he seems a little uncomfortable and nervous upon stage. I've had a few theories for why this might be the case. Maybe they get nervous because it's live and it's in front of an audience. But that can't be it because when you're acting, you're still on a set full of people that are watching. Maybe it's because it's a high pressure situation and there's a lot of emotions. That can't be it either. Actors are always performing with complicated emotions. I think the real answer is way deeper. When actors are acting, they are not themselves. They're shifting their identity and therefore mindset into whatever character they're playing. So, while Timothy Chalamet might be nervous to perform, Marty Mauser is not. When these actors truly shift who they are up here, they don't come with any of the baggage or insecurities that their original form has. And you can use this too. When you're speaking or performing or doing something outside of your comfort zone, maybe you shouldn't quite be yourself doing that thing. Maybe you should identify as a completely fictional character, one who's confident and not insecure the way that you are. If you do this, you might notice a swing of self-confidence overnight. And just like that, you can become a good speaker.
