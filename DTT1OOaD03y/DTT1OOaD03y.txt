This is not a political account, I talk about speaking. But sometimes, speaking is political. The Minneapolis mayor is getting some backlash for giving a speech in which he tells ICE to get the fuck out of Minneapolis for shooting and killing a woman. People seem to be outraged that a mayor would say something like this. They're mad that he would use this sort of language given that he is an elected official. They're saying it's unprofessional, that it's out of character. Clearly, these people don't seem to understand that that's exactly the point. When something happens that is so out of normalcy, out of character language is the only way to do it justice when discussing it. To properly convey how heavy a situation is, you can't just use words to describe it as heavy. You have to use words that are heavy in and of themselves. Egregious situations require egregious language. The mayor knows that, and that's why he said it. The very unprofessionalism it took to say that is the very thing that made saying it work. And if people truly understood that, not only would they not blame the mayor, they would understand how to use extreme language themselves. Not to be inflammatory, but to be genuinely productive.
