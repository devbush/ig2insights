When I told my parents what I wanted to do with my Stanford degree, this is probably not what they had in mind. And honestly, I didn't either. You see, for most of my life, I was on track to be a lawyer. I did debate, I watched all nine seasons of suits. I thought it was my calling. But when I got to college, it didn't take long for me to realize I didn't give a fuck about law. I just wanted to do things that involved people and presentation. So, my friends and I started a clothing brand. Not necessarily because I was a fashion demon or anything, but because it gave me the opportunity to make shit I love that helps people express themselves better and sometimes in ridiculous ways. As it got bigger and bigger, we thought to ourselves, "How far can we take this?" We create something that allows people to present themselves beyond just what they wear. And that's why now, since graduating from Stanford, I'm not pulling my hair out in some tax law class. I'm living with my best friends answering that question.
